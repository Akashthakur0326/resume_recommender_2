Making the GPUs go brr in service of saving millions of lives by helping design breakthrough new biomedicines.PopVax is an Indian full-stack biotechnology company developing novel mRNA vaccines and therapeutics using computational protein design. Our first vaccine is a next-generation COVID-19 booster, which will enter a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in the U.S. early this year. This vaccine is intended to broaden protection against both current and predicted future SARS-CoV-2 variants, reducing the possibility of a new mutation in the virus suddenly causing another massive wave of infection. We have a preclinical pipeline of 6 additional novel vaccine candidates built on our mRNA-LNP platform that we will be taking into clinical trials over the next few years. Our work to date has been funded primarily via project agreements totalling 10+ million USD with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Vitalik Buterin's public health & biosecurity organisation Balvi.At PopVax, we have seen up close that there are incredible capabilities in computational protein design just waiting to be unlocked that will enable us to pursue and perhaps even succeed at realizing wildly ambitious agendas such as preventing future pandemics via broadly-protective vaccines, tackling the deadly scourge of antimicrobial resistance, eliminating debilitating degenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, and curing fiendishly tricky chronic conditions such as ME/CFS and Long COVID.We seek to accelerate the development of these technologies while, at the same time, ensuring that the benefits they bring are available to everyone that needs them as soon as possible. If all of the advances made in this seminal moment are controlled by western pharmaceutical companies, they will do what they always do—hold on tight to the IP while people in the developing world die. We must ensure that we in the rising world are at the vanguard of this computational revolution, lest we condemn our people to remain forever at the mercy of the same corporate overlords who denied Africa affordable HIV antivirals in the late 90s and continue to deny Indians https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/health/cystic-fibrosis-drug-trikafta.html —just two among uncountable examples.We are building and refining a set of models using a variety of architectures—from transformers to graph neural networks to denoising diffusion models—to solve key problems in the design of vaccine antigens, targeted therapeutics, and nucleic acid delivery chemistry. We have already seen some impressive results from our work—early versions of our first vaccine candidate perform 10-120x better than existing mRNA vaccines in pseudovirus neutralization assays against key COVID-19 variants—but we need to expand our team with a small number of exceptionally competent and insatiably curious machine learning folks to keep the momentum going.The ideal candidate need not have existing knowledge of biology but needs to deeply understand current SOTA ML architectures, both in theory and implementation—we want someone just as comfortable reading the latest ICLR paper as implementing and training a large model on AWS. They must be willing to learn quickly, build fast, and act independently in an environment with a non-trivial amount of uncertainty, and be willing to rapidly change direction to wherever the data points.If you come and work with us, we hope that, in short order, its impact will accelerate work that saves or improves millions, and potentially billions, of lives. There aren’t many places that can offer you that kind of deep positive impact, not to mention the opportunity to work at the frontier of synthetic biology’s machine learning revolution.Join us!",Machine_Learning,"['biology', 'pharmaceutical', 'machine learning', 'moment', 'chemistry', 'design', 'aws', 'architectures', 'public health', 'training', 'health']","['Merchandise Revenue Rises', 'Pedro Pascal ’ ’', 'the next few years', 'Melinda Gates Foundation Vitalik Buterin', 'assays', 'COVID-19', 'ME/CFS Long COVID.We', 'USD Bill', 'early this year', 'Balvi.At PopVax', 'SOTA ML']",7

Had they opened up an API, they could have become an indispensable piece of the internet's infrastructure—every CRM, HR, and sales tool on the planet would connect to it for identity and network data. But they didn't.For two decades, this left a void. LinkedIn's network effects made it too hard for a new player to enter. Now, thanks to LLMs, the window of opportunity is open. Automation is exploding—20 years ago, every business suddenly needed a website; now, every business needs automation. Those who don't adopt will fall behind like those who didn't embrace the web. This new, massive ecosystem needs an identity and network layer.At the same time, LLMs let us do what wasn't possible before: stitch together data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive foundation for professional networks.Graph.one is building this missing link—an API-first platform that unifies relationships across email, calendar, LinkedIn, and more into a single, actionable graph. For the first time, people and companies can unlock and move the value of their network freely—no platform lock-in.We're pre-PMF, moving fast, and backed by top investors. We cut our teeth on large-scale social graph analysis and ML long before AI was cool. Our team includes seasoned data scientists, engineers, and design partners who are among the most innovative GTM and automation minds in the industry.About The TeamThe company is still small <10, so you will work directly with everyone. You will interact daily both with the CEO and the CTO. Everyone must be on the daily call, but other than that you make your own hours.What You'll DoPrototype, build, and automate: Design and ship GTM workflows, integrations, and experiments to drive user and revenue growth—using our own product, and best-in-class automation tools (n8n, Clay, Attio, etc.)Experiment relentlessly: Test, measure, and iterate on outbound and inbound growth loops. Build MVPs and scrappy solutions, not enterprise architecturesOwn tooling: Help us pick, implement, and integrate the right tools for prospecting, enrichment, CRM hygiene, and reportingDogfood: Use our own API to automate outreach, data enrichment, and lead qualification. Surface bugs, suggest features, and shape the product roadmapWork directly with founders: Collaborate closely with our CEO and CTO to design, prioritize, and run growth experimentsEngage with the best: Interact with design partners who are GTM/revops leaders—some of whom helped define this entire categoryContent & learnings: Document and share the best experiments as internal guides, case studies, or public contentRequirementsAbout YouYou're a builder and hacker at heart—you love learning new tools, figuring out how stuff works, and automating the boring partsYou're resourceful, thrive on ambiguity, and are comfortable moving fast with incomplete informationYou're technical—maybe you can code (Python, JS, or similar), maybe you're a no-code/low-code ninja, or maybe you just know how to get things workingYou're genuinely interested in go-to-market, growth, and helping products find tractionYou want to work at a company where your impact is visible, your work matters, and you help shape the product from the ground upYou get excited about collaborating with world-class GTM engineers, revops, and founders. Bonus points if:You've started a company, even if it failed (side hustles count)You've built or automated GTM processes, or hacked together technical side projects for fun or profit. BenefitsWork SetupWe're a fully remote team working from all over the world. We typically have a daily standup call and work mostly asynchronously apart from that. We are heavy users of remote work tools and continue testing new tools as they come out to make sure we have the best stack possible.How We HireWe don't care about fancy resumes or degrees—we care about what you've built, how you think, and how you solve problems. Instead of a CV, please answer the following questions (short is fine). It takes more time to fill out than a typical application, but the CEO reviews the answers directly.Process:Application review by the CEOTwo interviews (CEO & CTO)Paid trial week (remote/flexible)Fast decisions for the right candidate",NLP_Engineer,"['website', 'ai', 'prospecting', 'js', 'testing', 'automation', 'design', 'crm', 'analysis', 'experiments', 'api', 'sales', 'outreach', 'technical', 'email', 'workflows', 'python']","['BenefitsWork SetupWe', 'Use API', 'Build MVPs', 'Clay', 'daily', 'CEO CTO']",7
